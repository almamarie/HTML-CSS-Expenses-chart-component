## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned a lot about manipulating CSS styles with JavaScript. I also learned how to simulatue mouse hover events with the JavaScript DOM event listener.

### Continued development

I have found it difficult loading json data from a file because of the async await I had to use. This has confused me a lot and I need to research more on it. I also need to learn how to create graphs with JavaScript. Finally, I need to get conversant with all the Javascript event listeners.

The final area to work on is positioning elements. I struggled with this so much that I couldn't add it to the solution as the challenge required. I need to learn more about this
